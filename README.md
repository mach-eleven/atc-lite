Our gymnasium environment for the Air Traffic Control (ATC) problem.

Our agent is a reinforcement learning agent that learns to control the air traffic in a given airspace. It understands how to do so for 4 different aircraft, each with their own unique characteristics. The agent will be trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.
